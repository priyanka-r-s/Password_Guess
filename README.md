The Password Guessing Game is a simple Python-based console game where the computer randomly selects a secret word based on the chosen difficulty level. The player attempts to guess the word, and after each guess, the program provides hints showing how close the guess is to the secret password. The game also counts the number of attempts made by the player.
**Objectives**
To understand the use of loops and conditionals.To apply random word selection.To practice string manipulation.To implement a menu-driven program.To count and display the number of guesses
**Technologies Used**
Language: Python 3
Modules: random
